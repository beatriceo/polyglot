# polyglot
A video call application made with Ruby on Rails and node.js.

Video calling is made possible with [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/).

Signaling is done via ActionCable in Rails, a module that handles WebSockets. This section of the project was adapted from `@jeanpaulsio`'s project which can be found [here](https://github.com/jeanpaulsio/action-cable-signaling-server).

This Rails app was generated with [lewagon/rails-templates](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates), created by the [Le Wagon coding bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com) team.
